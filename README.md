# Sweet-life-On-Mars-V2
## A simple rocket flying game

### Description
In this application I used the knowledge I gathered while doing an Udemy C# and Unity Game Development Course to make a simple game.
So the technologies used are VScode, Unity and the programming language C#.
In this game you are a rocket and your goal is to reach the end of the level without crashing into objects around you.
The biggest challenge I faced was starting a game from scratch. Luckily, in the course, they teach you best practices when it comes to game design.
What steps you need to take BEFORE actually starting to develop your game, because a good design and plan is half the work.

### How to play
You can play the game just by downloading the zip file, unzipping it and clicking the .exe file. :) (I promise I'm not hacking your computer, or Am I?)

This is the course I took that gave me the knowledge on how to develop this game.
